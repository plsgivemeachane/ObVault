- Implement a recursive function that solves the problem by calling itself recursively on smaller subproblems.
- Use a data structure (often a hash table or array) to store solutions to subproblems that have already been computed.
- Before computing a solution to a subproblem, check if it's already stored in the data structure. If so, return the stored solution instead of recomputing it.
